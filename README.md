- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Charl. I enjoy getting the best out of people and processes and I use data to achieve this. I am currently on a mission to level up my data skills and gain a full time data role, adding value within Business Operations.
  
- ðŸ‘€ Apart from data, I love spending time outside being active and enjoying nature to balance out all that time sat at my desk. I am a keen traveller who likes to get off the beaten track. I often hitchhike solo across the countries I visit allowing me to connect with the locals as I go.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to apply my Python knowledge in a Business data setting. I am also advancing my SQL and sharpening up my Power BI skills. In October I begin the Microsoft Power Up Program to expand my knowledge and experiecen with the MS Power Platform.

- ðŸ“« I welcome the chance to connect and discuss ongoing projects or new opportunities. Please see my LinkedIn profile link to the left <<
